Starting Day Jan 3, 2017


<!--

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Added basic structure to the Weather App. Figured out the getLocation function

**Thoughts:** Need to get a better understanding up of to pull APIs. Been awhile since last working on Quoter API. Having trouble understanding all the pieces.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I have the main portion for the OpenWeather API in the code.

**Thoughts:** Was having trouble getting the lat and long to be implemented into the API. But now how about 90% of the api results working. Just need to understanding the $.ajax operator better.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Got the API to pull weather data! 

**Thoughts:** Need to modify a little more so it doesn't show full decimals. I got stuck initially around getting the icon to show. I didn't realize that the Object was inside an Array. After the little fix, pulled the icons in easily, though I would like to put a better icon set as the default icons from OpenWeatherAPI are not the greatest.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Found a tutorial on adding a CSS Toggle. Used that template to modify and add to my project

**Thoughts:** It appears that codepen.io is not utilizing the jquery normally as the .toggle() is not functioning properly. Need to investigate further.
