##### (delete me or comment me out)
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Added basic structure to the Weather App. Figured out the getLocation function

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I have the main portion for the OpenWeather API in the code.

**Thoughts:** Was having trouble getting the lat and long to be implemented into the API. But now how about 90% of the api results working. Just need to understanding the $.ajax operator better.
